Ansible Installation(Installation to be done on ansible server machine only and not on host machine)

yum install wget -y #install wget package if it not there
wget https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm #download epel package repository from internet
yum install epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm -y #install the epel package
yum update -y #update the OS for updating the packages and dependency files
yum install git python python-pip python-devel openssl ansible -y #install these packages(ansible is main package and rest all other are dependency package for ansible as ansible is developed using python)

After installation, in /etc/ansible folder ansible config file and host file will be created
Open the ansible.cfg file and uncomment inventory line and sudo user line and save the file
Open the hosts file and add the host machines IP address or create the group and add host machines IP addresses

#Linux Administration commands

useradd <username> #command to add new user. NOTE: for ansible operations, the username of ansible server machine and ansible host machine should be same
passwd <username> #to set password of the specific user

#give root user privileges to ansible user on ansible server machine as well as on ansible host machine
for giving root user privileges, linux system have sudoers files in which multiple user can work on that single file at onetime which can create a huge conflict
so redhat company has created a new file called as visudo file for resolving this problem as only one user can work on this file at a time

#open visudo file and add the ansible user inside it and give all root user privileges
<ansible username> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

#for creating ssh connection we have to first enable the password authentication to yes and permitrootlogin to yes with uncommenting
inside the file /etc/ssh/sshd_confg in all machines that is server as well as host
without enable authentication it will give permission denied error

#after enable authentication, by default behaviour will be to enter password everytime for connection making between server and host
so we have to generate ssh key in server machine to make trustable connection with host machine by copying public key in host machine ssh folder

For making connection from server machine to host machine we will ssh connection
ssh username@IPaddress (example ssh ansible@171.41.32.1) #command for making ssh connection

ssh key generation command below:
ssh-keygen 

After ssh key generation we have to copy public key from server machine to host machine using below command:
ssh-copy-id username@IPaddress

#ansible commands

ansible --version #to check ansible version and information
ansible all --list-hosts #to check all host connected to ansible server machine in ansible configuration file
ansible <groupname> --list-hosts #to check all host connected of specific group  to ansible server machine
ansible <groupname>[n:n] --list-hosts #to check host connected of specific group with index number to ansible server machine
examples below:
ansible webserver[0] --list-hosts
ansible webserver[1] --list-hosts
ansible webserver[-1] --list-hosts
ansible webserver[0:2] --list-hosts
ansible webserver[0]:dbserver[1] --list-hosts

#ansible adhoc commands
ansible <groupname> -a "Normal linux commands" #where groupname can groupname or a single host or IP and -a is arbitary mode as arbitary command and under quotes can be any linux commands
ansible ansiblehosts -a "ls -la"
ansible ansiblehosts[0] -a "touch faizanfile"
ansible ansiblehosts[1] -a "sudo yum install tree -y" #to install software as sudo user we have to enter sudo
If we dont want to insert sudo before the linux commands then below is the command
ansible ansiblehosts -b -a "yum install httpd -y" #where -b denotes become sudo user and -a is arbitary command
ansible ansiblehosts -b -a "which httpd" or -a "sudo which httpd"
ansible ansiblehost -b -a "yum remove httpd -y"

#ansible single module commands
ansible ansiblehosts -b -m yum -a "pkg=httpd state=present" #(this command will install httpd software as state as present)where b denotes to become root, -m denotes as module, yum is module, -a is arbitary command, pkg is package package or software name, state is state whether to install or update or remove software or stop or start or restart service
ansible ansiblehosts -b -m yum -a "pkg=httpd state=latest" #this command will update the httpd software to latest version
ansible ansiblehosts -b -m yum -a "pkg=httpd state=absent" #this command will remove or uninstall httpd software
ansible ansiblehosts -b -m service -a "name=httpd state=started" #this command will start the httpd service, where service is module, -m denotes as module, name is service name, state is service state as started or restarted or stopped
ansible ansiblehosts -b -m user -a "name=username state=present" #this command will create or add new user, where user is module
ansible ansiblehosts -b -m yum -a "pkg=httpd" #this command will install httpd, here we have not mention state as by default state is to be install(present) for packages, for user by default state is to create(present) for user, for service by default state is to start(started), for file or folder by default state is to create(present)
ansible ansiblehosts -b -m copy -a "src=(path with file) dest=(destination path)" #this command will copy file from server machine to host machines

#ansible playboook commands (using YAML language)
playbooks will be create using yaml language so so playbook file extensions will be .yaml or .yml

#Vault concenpt in ansible (that is encrypting the playbook file and also add password protection to playbook file)
ansible-vault create <playbook name> #for creating new playbook with vault
ansible-vault edit <playbook name> #for editing vault playbook
ansible-vault encrypt <playbook name> #for encrypting and vault the exisiting playbook
ansible-vault decrypt <playbook name> #for decrypting the playbook
ansible-vault rekey <playbook name> #for changing password of vault playbook

#Role concept in ansible (Role is basically distributing one large playbook into small directories)
playbook folder (folder name must be playbook only)
Inside playbook folder, create master.yml file and folder roles (here also filename and folder name must be same as its mentioned)
Inside roles folder create one folder with any name (example ansiblehosts)
Inside ansiblehosts folder, create different folders with name tasks, vars, handlers (folder names must be same as its mentioned)
Inside every folder i.e tasks, vars, handlers. Create main.yml file and write the code in every main.yml according to the requirement
Inside playbook folder,  write the code in master.yml file as per the requirement
Run the master.yml file by being the present director that is playbook directory with ansible-playbook master.yml command

playbook
- master.yml
- roles
	- ansiblehosts
		- tasks
			- main.yml
		- vars 
			- main.yml
		- handlers
			- main.yml
